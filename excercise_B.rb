# Now we would like you to make a class that represents a sports team.
#
# Make a class to represent a Team that has the properties Team name (String), Players (array of strings) and a Coach (String).
# For each property in the class make a getter method than can return them.
# Create a setter method to allow the coach's name to be updated.
# Refactor the class to use attr_reader or attr_accessor instead of your own getter and setter methods.
# Create a method that adds a new player to the players array.
# Add a method that takes in a string of a player's name and checks to see if they are in the players array.
# Add a points property into your class that starts at 0.
# Create a method that takes in whether the team has won or lost and updates the points property for a win.

  attr_reader(
    :team_name,
    :players,
    :coach
  )
